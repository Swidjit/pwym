    %h3 About PlayWithYourMind.com

    %p My name is Alex, and I am the owner and the brains behind this site. Let me take a minute to tell you a little more about playwithyourmind.com.
    %p This site first started in September ’04 when I decided to forego another year as a Montessori teacher and instead build a website. At that point, I had a number of different ideas for online mind games – games that would be challenging and fun yet also enriching. My original inspiration was the game “Where’s Waldo”, a very simple search game that at one point in my childhood, seemed to sweep the nation. I figured that this concept was but one of a possibly infinite number of ways to challenge the mind’s awesome powers with games, and so I set out to explore those possibilities.
    %p At that time, I knew nothing about programming or web development. so I bought myself a few books and starting reading tutorials on the internet. I spent nearly three weeks developing my first game (Pochle) and a similar amount of time trying to build a working website. Since that time I have gone on to release nearly 100 original games, ranging from word games to search games to mouse games. The wesbite has imporved with each release (currently version 6 or 7) and will continue to grow as well.
    %p Yet, all this is still just the beginning. My goal is nothing less than making the world’s premiere destination for online gaming – for children, adults and seniors alike (see kidbraingames.com and sharpenthemind.com). While all the games are currently single-player, I will soon be creating opporuntities for league/tournament play and then eventually multi-player gaming. My imagination is vast and bold and I think you will like what I have in store for you gamers….
    %p Remember, these are games centered around words, numbers, symbols, space and sounds. If you are looking for games with fancy graphics and murderous weapons, you can leave now because you’ll find none of that here. But if you are looking for a way to hone your mind, or to exercise your special mental talents – or just a way to have some good clean fun – you’ve found the right place. Come on in and play with your mind.
