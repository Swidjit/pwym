    %h3 Brain Gym
    %p Mostly everyone agrees that regular visits to the gym are a very good thing, particularly if you are not involved in any intense physical activity in the regular course of your workdays or play-time. Without physical exercise we become weaker, less flexible and generally more prone to injury. No, the brain is not a muscle, but it does sort of behave like one – mental functions you use a lot tend to get stronger and more easily accessible, whereas ones you ignore or forget about become difficult to summon and can eventually fade from your mind. There are all sorts of practical examples of this, from language to music to motor memory to mental math – if you don’t keep using these abilities, they tend to get weaker and weaker and weaker.
    %p Enter the brain gym. More and more neuroscientists seem to agree that brain exercise can be an effective way to keep the mind sharp. This should not come as a surprise to anyone who has lost an under-used skill or acquired a new one through practice and determination. In fact, we might one day consider mental exercise just as important as physical exercise.
    %p While many people using this site are doing it for just fun or distraction, this whole site is effectively a big brain gym. There are all sorts of different games, puzzles and tests to exercise the myriad mental functions we all posses. Just 15-30 minutes a couple times a week might go a long way towards maintaining or even improving your mental fitness. And all at a fraction of the cost of a gym… next to nothing really…. actually it’s all free.
