<instructions>The play of this game is really quite simple.  You have cards in your hand, and cards on the board.  You will alternate played between your hand and the board, playing onto a center pile.  In order to play a card onto the pile, it must be of the same suit or the same value of the card currently on top of the pile.</instructions>
<instructions>You begin by playing from your hand.  Choose a card, and click on it to play it-it will appear at now in the middle as the first card on the pile.  Now you must play from the board and  the only cards available to you are the ones at the bottom of each column.  You must select one of them that is either that the same suit, or the same face value as the card you just play from your hand.  Click on it to play it.</instructions>
<instructions>Again goes on like that back and forth between your hand and the board.  The ultimate goal is to clear the board, getting rid of all the cards in your hand.  However, as this can be difficult to do, you do not need to get all of the cards to pass the board, you can leave up to three remaining and still move on.  As usual though, the fewer remaining, the better your score.</instructions>
<instructions>This is one of the more difficult games on the site.  It requires great care and planning; one bad move can end your game.  However, if you have the sort of mind that can plan many moves ahead, this could be the game for you.</instructions>
<instructions>It is also important to note that you are not playing with cards as you know them.  Instead these are our version of cards which are ultimately easier to work with and more logical.  There are no face cards nor aces, instead each card is labeled with between 1 and 12 dots, correlating to cards valued 1 - 12. Instead of two red suits and two black suits, our cards each have their own color.  Ultimately, the only difference in terms of functionality is that there are 48 cards instead of 52.</instructions>
