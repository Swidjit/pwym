<instructions>In the beginning of a round you will be given 18 letters.  Using each letter only once, you want to try to build the highest scoring words you can (you can build up to 5 words per round). To make a word, simply drag a letter into one of the slots and it will be added to the end of the word.  When you have used as many letters as you can, and built the highest scoring combination of words, hit the SUBMIT button to continue.</instructions>
<instructions>Scoring is calculated as (word length x word value).  More difficult letters are worth more in calculating the word value.  You can see the value for any set of letters to the right of the slot for that word.</instructions>
<instructions>In order to pass to the next round, you may leave no more than the target number of letters for the round, indicated in the scorebar.  This value begins at 8 but decreases to as little as 2 as the game progresses. Anytime you leave fewer letters than this target number, you will get a special bonus for using so many of the letters.</instructions></info>
