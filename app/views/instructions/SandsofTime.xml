<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The object of this  game is to drop the colored balls into the moving hole.  The challenge is to time your drops so that the balls fall into the hole instead of hitting the ground.</instructions><instructions>Each round you will start with different colored balls falling from the top of the screen and the hole moving back and forth along the bottom.  As long as the balls are in the top part of the playing field (any of the darker gray areas above the purple line) you may drag and drop them into any part of this upper region.  The higher up you place the ball, the better your score will be if you can get it in the hole (values indicated by numbers in each field). Once a ball has completely passed the purple line, you cannot move it anymore.</instructions><instructions>In order to pass a round, you must catch at least half of the balls with the hole before your time runs out.  Your score will be based on a combination of how much time you have left, your ratio of catches versus misses, and the score earned during play (based on the height that you drop in from).</instructions></info>
