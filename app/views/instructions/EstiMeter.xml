There are a total of 144 squares and you need to guess how many of each color (red, blue, green, yellow) there are.  Fill in your guesses in the appropriate boxes before time expires. In Stage 2, you need to make a quick count of how many objects are on the screen and type your answer into the box before time runs out.  In Stage 3, you need to guess what percentage (1-100) of the playing board is covered with black (as opposed to gray).  In Stage 4, you need to estimate how many of the smaller red boxes would fit inside the larger blue box, or rather, how many times bigger the blue box is than the red one.</instructions><instructions>To pass the first level, you need to earn 100,000 points, to pass level 2 you need 200,000 points, level 3 300,000 and so on.
