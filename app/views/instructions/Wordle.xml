<instructions>The object then of Wordle is to build words with the letters you receive.  One by one you will receive letters and you need to decide where to place them or what to do with them in order to best make words.</instructions>
<instructions>There are three different fields where you can place your letters, and each of these fields contains six spaces. When adding a letter to a field it will occupy the rightmost spot and push any existing letters in the field towards the left. Each time you place a letter into a field, the field is evaluated and checked for English words.  Every word four letters or more will be counted. That is, if your field contains the string "PLAYER", you will receive points for the words "player", "layer", and "play" (but not "lay").</instructions>
<instructions>On the right hand side of the game are a number of different elements to assist you in your play.  There is a queue that can hold up to two letters at a time, so you can store a couple letters here if you don't want to place them in any of the three letter fields.  At any time you can clear a space in the queue by moving one of its letters into one of the three fields.</instructions>
<instructions>In addition to the queue there are a couple kinds of cheats. The destroy cheats that will delete the current letter if you don't like it. The vowel cheat will let you change a vowel to a different vowel.  The color cheat will let you change the color of your piece (you get extra points for words that are all one color).</instructions></info>
