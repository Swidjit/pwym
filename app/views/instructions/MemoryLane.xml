<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The object of this game is to identify the objects you have already seen.  That is, various objects (words, numbers, colors & shapes) will float across your screen, and you need to pick out the objects you have already seen pass you by.</instructions><instructions>For instance, in the first round, you are dealing with just words.  They will appear on the right and move across the screen to the left.  Read them all and do your best to remember them.  Once you see a word that has already appeared during that round (a match), click on it to score (if you are right, you will get a 'catch' but if incorrect you will get a 'wrong').  If the match passes across the screen and vanishes before you click it, you will be penalized with a 'miss'.  In order to pass a round, you must catch more pieces than you miss or get wrong (catches >= missed + wrong).</instructions><instructions>The game moves in a cycle of 4 stages.  Stage 1 is just words, stage 2 words & numbers, stage 3 words, numbers & colors,  and stage 4 words, numbers, colors & shapes.</instructions></info>
