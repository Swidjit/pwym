<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The goal of this game is to type the text shown to you exactly as it appears.  Any discrepancies between your keystrokes and the expected characters will be counted as typos.  The object of the game is to type as fast as possible without making mistakes, because once you have committed 10 typing errors, your game is over.</instructions>
<instructions>Each round, after the timer counts down, you will be shown a "sentence" that you need to type.  Type it as fast as you can with out messing up.  If you do make a mistake, and type the wrong a character, do not try to backspace and correct your mistake.  This is already a typo and you cannot get out of it; if you try to do so you will only get yourself deeper in trouble. If you make a typo, you should just continue on with the sentence. For reference, the character you need to type will always appear in the top left corner, in a white box.</instructions>
<instructions>You have a chance to play a bonus round if you type the sentence with out a making any mistakes.  In the bonus round, you will just be given a sequence of words to type as fast as possible.  You'll have a total of 10 seconds, and the more words that you can type in in those 10 seconds, the higher your will score.</instructions>
<instructions>Your score for a round depends on your stroke rate (characters per second) and how many errors you make during a round.  Remember, your game ends as soon as you make your 10th typo.</instructions></info>
