<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The object of this game is to prevent the rising mass of blocks from hitting the top row.  To do so, you need to eliminate blocks from the playing board using math.</instructions>
<instructions>On the right of the screen there is a column of operations such as (+ 3) or (x 4).  To play, drag one of these operations onto two adjacent pieces on the board to make an equation.  For instance, you could drag the (+ 3) onto a (4)(7) or a  (x 4) onto a (12)(3).  The numbers can appear in any order so long as they are adjacent (+3 can go on 4-7 and 7-4).  Pick up an operation by pressing on it once, and then releasing the mouse button - do not drag.  Bring your mouse where you want to place the operation and click again when the appropriate numbers are highlighted. If you want to play an equation vertically, just hit SPACE to rotate your piece (and again to switch back).</instructions>
<instructions>Your score is a combination of 3 things: a) points accumulated from your plays (using large numbers and multiplication gives you more points), b) how low you keep the board during play (try to keep the columns as low to the ground as you can) and c) how low the board is at the end of the round. Your game is over when you allow blocks to move beyond the top row.</instructions></info>
