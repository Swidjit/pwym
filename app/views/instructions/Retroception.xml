<instructions>In the game of Retroception, you will be trying to click on targets after they disappear.  In the beginning of each round there will be a number of targets visible on your screen.  Each target has three different zones: an outer zone (blue), a middle zone (green), and in inner zone (red).</instructions>
<instructions>The goal is to try to click as close as possible to where the target was (before it disappeared).  If you hit it directly in the center (the red zone), it will give your score a big boost, but as long as you get within the outer zone, you will have hit the target.  If you don't hit within the outer zone, you will score a miss (not clicking at all when you should have counts as a miss too).  Complete the round with fewer than 10 misses in order to move on to the next round.  The faster you are, the more accurate you are, and the fewer mistakes you make, the higher your score will be.</instructions>
<instructions>Each successive round the targets will decrease in size, making it more difficult to hit them.</instructions></info>
