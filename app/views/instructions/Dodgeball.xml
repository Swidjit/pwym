<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>In the game of Dodgeball, you are trying to go around collecting all of the balls in numerical order. That is, you will start off going after the one-ball and once you get it, you will be going for the two-ball, then the three-ball and so on. Once you get to a ball, just click on it to capture it-if you are successful, it will turn gray.  It is a game of dodgeball because you simultaneously need to avoid any balls that are not currently your target.  That means that while you are going for the one-ball, your cursor can not make contact with any of the other balls (numbered balls or the gray balls) -  if it does you will lose a life and your scoring streak will be reset.</instructions><instructions>The game will start off relatively simple.  In the beginning of each round, you have several seconds of immunity which will allow you to position yourself away from any balls when the round begins.  At that point, you need to go through and collect the balls one by one, from 1 to 9.  You lose if you are unable to collect all the balls in the allotted time, or once you have lost five lives (once you to hit five balls).  If you pass a round, you will move on to the next round where the balls will be a little faster and bigger.  Every 10 rounds, the size of the board decreases giving you last available room to work.</instructions><instructions>It is important to know how the scoring works.  The value that you get for any particular ball depends on how many balls you have captured before it without losing a life.  For instance, on your first catch of the game, or your first catch after losing a life, you might get 10 points.  The next ball would be worth 20 points, the next worth 40, the next 80 and so on until you lose a life at which point the point value for capturing a ball is reset.  So the way had to get a large score in this game is to go a long time without losing a life as each subsequent ball will be worth twice what the previous one was worth.</instructions></info>
