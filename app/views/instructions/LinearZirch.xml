<instructions>The object of this game is very simple: find the letters Z, I, R, C, and H. They will be traveling along the screen hidden amongst a bunch of other letters, and you need to find them and click them before they move off the screen. </instructions>
<instructions>At first, the letters will all travel in the same direction, but every five rounds a new direction will be added so that they are eventually coming at you from every which way.  Each round, you must find a certain number of targets in order to pass (as indicated above the playing field)</instructions>
