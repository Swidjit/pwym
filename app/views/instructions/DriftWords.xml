<instructions>The goal of this game is to build words.  The longer the words and the faster you build them, the higher your score.   The game board consists of letters drifting around the screen.  To make words, click on the individual letters in the right order.  For instance, if you saw the letters Z, E, R, B and A floating around, click on the Z then E then B then R then A and then hit the space bar to submit you word. As you add letters, you will see your growing word on the left of the screen.  You may undo previous moves by hitting the left arrow key or by clicking on the word display.</instructions>
<instructions>Each round you need to earn 500 points to pass. Each word is scored by the sum of its letter values times the length of the word.  So making a word like 'rant' will be much less valuable then making a word like 'quizzical'. The faster you can get the 500 points to pass the level, the higher your score.  You will also earn extra bonus for making words 6 letters or longer.</instructions>
<instructions>The trick to all of this is that you have a limited amount of time to make each word.  You will see a green progress bar at the bottom of the game board that shows the amount of time left to make a word.  Once this time expires, you will begin drawing time from a time bank.  If this ever runs out, your game is over.  Otherwise, once you submit a correct word, your word timer will reset and your time bank will stop ticking.</instructions>
<instructions>You need to earn 500 points within 2.5 minutes to pass a round.  Each successive round the letters move faster and there are fewer of them.</instructions>
