<tip>This is a game of focus.  Your job is to pay very careful attention to each of the sliding numbers on the gameboard.  As the sliders move back and forth within the bar, you need to press the number each time it passes over one of the red target areas.</tip>
<tip>The actual game will start with 4 of these bars (numbers 1-4) lined up in a column.  Each numbered slider will be moving back and forth, and you need to press the appropriate key each time any of these sliders pass over any of the red target areas.  Any time you fail to do so, you will record a miss. Anytime you press a number that is not currently over one of its red areas, you will record a mistake.  Each of these will deduct from your score.  
<tip>Most of your scoring is determined by your accuracy.  While you will register a hit if any part of the blue square touches any red, you want to try to hit it when they overlap exactly.  If you hit a target, the number will briefly flash green; if you make a mistake, it will flash gray.</tip>
<tip>The game will get progressively more difficult as you move through the rounds, as you will have to monitor more sliders and they will move faster.  The game ends when you miss/mistake more than 25 times in any given round.</tip>
