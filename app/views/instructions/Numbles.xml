<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The game of Numbles is based on a very simple concept, but its play is a little unusual.  You will start with a grid of numbers.  This grid will have a value based on the number of different sets that appear within it.  In this case, the sets are based on common mathematical relationships, like odd numbers, even numbers, prime numbers, product sets, etc.  A set here is defined as three numbers that appear consecutively in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  For instance, if the numbers 5, 7, 9 appeared consecutively in a column, row, or diagonal, you would get points for having an odd set.  If 3, 7, 11 appeared consecutively, you would get points for both an odd set and a prime set. </instructions><instructions>So, the object of the game is to rearrange the board so that it has the highest possible value, based on the appearance of as many of these mathematical sets as possible.  The different types of sets are assigned different point values, so you have to arrange the numbers to make the most points, not just the most sets.  GCF or greatest common factor sets are particularly valuable in this game. A GCF set is something like 3, 6, 15, (these numbers have a greatest common factor of 3).  Getting a set like this will add 3 to your GCF value.  So, if you had four GCF sets with GCFs of 3, 3, 4, and 7, you would have a GCF value of 17.  This number 17 is a then multiplied by five to give you your total points for GCFs.  (Note: only sets with GCFs of 3 or higher are counted in the game.  A set with a greatest common factor of 1 or 2 will not be considered a valid scoring set.) </instructions><instructions> Each round you will be given a limited number of moves and a limited amount of time to rearrange the board.  You must use your moves wisely, and make them quickly.  Your progress is shown in the box on the lower left corner, which shows you the current value of the grid and the target value you need in order to pass the round.  If you reach this target, you move on to the next round.  If not, game over!  To adjust the board, simply click and drag a number onto another number.  The two numbers will switch places, and the new board value will be shown.</instructions></info>
