<instructions>The object of this game is to type the simple words provided using a reassigned keyboard layout.  That is, the keyboard will not type as you are accustomed to, but rather will adhere to the rules as defined by the graphical representation on your screen.  If the key traditionally associated with 'A' is now labeled 'H', an 'h' will output any time you hit the 'a' key.</instructions> 
<instructions>Each round, the keyboard assignment will be different and  your job is to overcome this challenge and type the words (five per round) as fast as possible. There is no backspace key, so if you make a mistake, continue typing until the word is automatically submitted and then start over again.</instructions>
