<instructions>Each round you will need to type a series of 'sentences' containing words and punctuation. As the sentences appear, you need to duplicate them as quickly as you can (before the blue progress bar at bottom runs out).</instructions>
<instructions>Each time you get a sentence correct, you will move up one notch on the color ladder (on the right), but each time you miss a sentence you will move down (move off the bottom and your game is over). The goal of the game is to reach the top of this ladder before the round time expires.</instructions>
<instructions>Unlike the previous Typo game, you can make corrections in this game (such as using the backspace or arrow keys to edit). In fact, you must duplicate the sentence exactly in order to move on to the next one.</instructions>
