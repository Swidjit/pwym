<instructions>The object of the game is to determine the correct colors for all the balls on the screen.  In the beginning of each round, they will all start off gray, and you needed to figure out what color they are based on how they interact with the game board.</instructions>
<instructions>There are four colored balls in this game: red, blue, green, and purple. In the the center of the playing board you will see four colored boxes, correlating to the four different colored balls.  When a red ball passes beneath the red square, it activates the square, but when a red ball passes through any other zone, nothing happens.  So, when a colored a zone lights up, it does so to indicate the presence of a ball of like color within the zone.  So, you just need to pay attention very carefully and notice what ball has just entered or exited a zone when its activation state changes.  If you see a zone become active at the same moment that a ball enters it, that most likely means that you know the color of that ball. </instructions>
<instructions>When you have determined the color of a ball, you can color it in using the colored boxes at bottom.  Grab the color you want, then drag and drop it onto the ball; if you are correct, the ball will color in, if not you will register a mistake.</instructions>
<instructions>The game is scored based on how quickly you can complete each board; the faster you can do it, the higher your score will be.  You also get points for each correct ball colored and lose points for each incorrect color guess you make.</instructions></info>
