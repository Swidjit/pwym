<instructions>In this game, and you will be working to adjust the value of a 5 x 5 grid of cards, in accordance with some rules of poker.  That is, you will be trying to strategically arrange the grid of cards such that it makes the best combination of poker hands that you can.</instructions>
<instructions>This 5 x 5 grid contains exactly 12 poker hands that will be evaluated at the end of each round.  There are five horizontal ones, five vertical ones, and two diagonal hands, and each of these will be evaluated and scored based on the strength of the hand.</instructions>
<instructions>Each round, you will need to adjust the board to try to create the most viable configuration. You may switch any to cards A and B by dragging card A and dropping it on to card B.  When you have reached a configuration that you are happy with, you may  submit the board with the button on the left; or if  your time runs out, your board will be submitted automatically.</instrucions>
<instructions>In order to pass a round, you must get at least three major hands (straight flush, full house, four of a kind, straight or flush) in addition to meeting the total point requirement for the round.  That is, if you need to get 300 points in a round, the score after tallying the results earned from each of the 12 hands must exceed 300.</instructions>
<instructions>It is also important to note that you are not playing with cards as you know them.  Instead these are our version of cards which are ultimately easier to work with and more logical.  There are no face cards nor aces, instead each card is labeled with between 1 and 12 dots, correlating to cards valued 1 - 12. Instead of two red suits and two black suits, our cards each have their own color.  Ultimately, the only difference in terms of functionality is that there are 48 cards instead of 52.</instructions>
