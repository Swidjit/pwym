<instructions>In Keyball, the game board is drawn up into squares that represent keys on your keyboard.  Red balls and blue balls float around the board.  In order to win, catch the blue balls and avoid the red balls!  </instructions>
<instructions>Catching blue balls is simple.  When you see a key field with only blue balls in it, just press its corresponding key on your keyboard.  The letter on the game board will light up, and you will get points based on the number of blue balls that are in the field at that time.  You may press any number of keys at the same time, but you may only press any individual key once every two seconds (so no hitting just one key over and over).  The goal is to catch as many of the blue balls as possible in a single key field at the same time.  For instance, if you catch two blue balls together you will get a good score, but if you catch four of them together you will get an even better score (and catching four together once is better than catching two together twice).  However, if a red ball is in a key field when you select it, you will get a strike, and no points will be scored.</instructions>
<instructions>Your round will continue until you get 10 strikes, or run out of time.  In order to advance, you must reach the target number of blue balls before the round ends.</instructions>
<instructions>Your progress in this area is indicated by the blue bar at the bottom of the screen.  Once you have exhausted this bar, you can be confident that you have passed the round.  In some of the levels, you will see small green balls.  These are bonus balls.  By themselves, they are worth nothing, but if you catch one in a field along with one or more blue balls, it will multiply your score for that keystroke by a factor of 10.  If you happened to catch two bonus balls together along with some blue balls, each one would contribute a factor of 10!</instructions></info>
