You will see a random assortment of letters, and your job is to find all the letters that spell the word Zirch.  In the bottom left corner of the game screen, you will find a box that shows your target letters.  The goal, of course, is to find every Z, I, R, C, and H before time runs out.  </instructions><instructions> In order to continue on to the next round, you must find at least one of each of the five letters and ten letters total.  If you do manage to find all of the letters, you will get a bonus, and in general, the more letters you find, the more points you will get.  There are five different boards in the game of Zirch. </instructions><instructions> After you have gone through these five boards, the cycle will start again with the first board, only this time there will be more letters, and they will be moving faster.  The further into the game you get, the more frantic the search becomes. </instructions></info>
