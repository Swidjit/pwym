<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>MemorEyes is a game that tests your visual memory.  There are four different stages that you will cycle through in this game.  The first is a color round where you will have to remember colors, the second deals with letters and fonts, the third deals with photographs and pictures, and the last deals with shape and orientation. </instructions><instructions> In each round, you will be given a grid to memorize.  The first grid will be 3 x 3, but grid size will increase with each four-round cycle.  Soak in the contents of the grid as long as you'd like, and then hit the button to move on to the recall stage.  In this stage, you will start off with a blank slate and you must cycle through each grid point and try to remember which objects belong where.  Each time you click on a square of the grid, you will cycle through your possible options.  In the early rounds, your options will be limited, making your recollection easier, but as the game goes on there will be more options to choose from.  When you have assembled the grid to the best of your memory, hit the submit button and your round will be scored.</instructions><instructions> You are scored on how accurately you remembered the original grid.  You are given 10 minutes to play this game.  The faster you can memorize a board, and the faster you can recall it, the further you will be able to get in this game.</instructions></info>
