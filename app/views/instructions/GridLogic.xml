<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The ultimate goal of each level is to finish with only one piece remaining, preferably a 1.  Each round is scored based two things: the number of pieces remaining, and the total numerical value of those pieces. </instructions><instructions> To play, reduce the board by moving adjacent pieces of consecutive value on top of each other. In other words, as long as they are touching (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), you may move a 2 onto a 3, or a 5 onto a 4.  When you do this, the piece being moved will replace the piece you drop it onto.  There is great strategy involved in how you play each board.  If you use up any particular number too quickly, you can easily get stuck.  Or, if you're not careful, you can cut off a section of the board, leaving it inaccessible.</instructions><instructions>In order to pass each round, you must reach both a target number of pieces and a target number of points.  These targets are represented by the progress bars on the left side of the screen.  If you run out of moves or the timer runs out before the progress bars meet their targets, your game will be over!  Once you are done reducing the board, you may submit at any time using the submit button on the left.</instructions></info>
