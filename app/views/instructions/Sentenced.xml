<instructions>The object of this game is to reassemble a jumbled sentence.  Each round, you will get a bunch of words that you need to arrange into a grammatically and logically correct sentence.  All of the component words will start off in the top box.  Take a look at them and try to get a feel for what the sentence should look like.  When you have a good idea of how it goes together, you can add a word to your new sentence by clicking on it (you may also drag your word into the lower box).  Continue on like this to complete the sentence.  If your sentence is correct, the round will end and you can proceed to the next round.  If it is incorrect, you must try to rearrange it.</instructions>
<instructions>There are a number of different ways to rearrange the words if you make a mistake.  You can click and drag a word to another spot in the sentence.  You may also highlight a word and move it through the sentence with the arrow keys.  If you want to bring a word to the end of the sentence, simply drag it onto the drop box.  And if you've totally messed up, you can hit the Reset Words button to start from scratch.</instructions>
<instructions>The sentences in this game have been carefully edited to try to avoid any sentences that can be arranged in multiple correct ways.  So, in most instances, there is only one arrangement of the words that is clearly correct.  However, due to the complexity of language, there may still be instances where a sentence can be arranged in two different ways.  If you have a sentence that is correct but is not accepted, take a moment to find other correct solutions.</instructions>
<instructions>The round will automatically end when you have put together the sentence correctly.  Your score in each round is based on how quickly and how efficiently you complete the sentence.  Currently, there is a limited number of sentences available, so after a while you will start to see repeat sentences.</instructions>
