To do so, you need to click on them in ascending numerical order, starting with the smallest and ending witht the largest.</instructions><instructions>The numbers will start off arranged in a grid.  You start by finding the smallest number and clicking on it.  If you are correct, it will disappear; if not, nothing will happen and you need to keep searching for a lower number.  When you do find the right number, it disappears and the numbers above fall down into its place and fill the holes.</instructions><instructions>You need to finish the board (remove all the numbers) to pass to the next round.  Your score is based on a) the size of the board you complete, b) how fast you complete it, and c) how many incorrect guesses you make (you will lose points each time you click on the wrong number).</instructions></info>
