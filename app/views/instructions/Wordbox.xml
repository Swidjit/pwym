<instructions>Welcome to the Wordbox.  The object of this game is to build words by filling letters into a grid.  Each round you will be presented with a grid containing a set of pre-determined letters running down along the diagonal.  The rest of the grid spaces will be empty, and your job is to strategically fill them to build words along the horizontal and vertical lines.  For instance, in the first grid (4x4), you could make a total of 8 words (4 horizontal ones and 4 vertical ones), although this is decidedly difficult.</instructions>
<instructions>To build the words, simply drag letters from your choices below and place them into the grid.  You can easily switch letters around, or you can reset the whole board with the 'RESET' button if you want to start fresh.  Once you are happy with your wordbox, hit the 'SUBMIT' button and your grid will be scored. In order to pass a round, you must make [gridsize+1] correct words (so when gridsize is 4 you need to make 5/8 possible words).</instructions>
<instructions>Your score will be based on a) how many words you make and b) the value of the individual words (using obscure letters such as Q and J will give you higher scores).</instructions></info>
