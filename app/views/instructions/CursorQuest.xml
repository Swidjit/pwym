<instructions>Welcome to Cursor Quest.  The object of this game is to score as many 'runs' as possible while avoiding all the obstacles in your path. To score a run, you need to work your piece (the black circle) around the bases (the red/blue diamonds), just like in baseball. You start by moving to first (right side) and then to second (top) then third (left) and home (bottom).  Each time you complete this cycle you will earn a run.  The base you need to reach next is colored red and rotated for emphasis.</instructions>
<instructions>Meanwhile, there are all sorts of other circles and squares flying around the board.  You must avoid these.  Each time you hit one, you will lose energy (indicated by the blue bar on the left.  Once you run out of energy your round is complete.</instructions>
<instructions>The goal is to get as many runs as you can before your time runs out (while losing as little energy as possible). If your time or energy run out before you score enough runs, game over.</instructions></info>
