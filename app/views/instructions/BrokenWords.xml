<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><info><instructions>The object of this game is to reconstruct the words that have been broken up into pieces and mixed together.  Every round, the target words you need to reconstruct had been split apart into chunks of two letters.  For instance, the word "garage" would be broken up into "ga" and "ra" and "ge", and mixed together with the other chunks from the other words.</instructions><instructions>To start, you will have three 6 letter words that have been broken apart.  On the left-hand side of the screen are three slots where you can construct the words, and on the right side of the screen are all the component chunks that make up the words.  In this instance, since each word is broken up into three groups of two letters, there are three columns of chunks.  The first column represents the beginnings of the words, the middle column represents the middle of the words, and the last column represents the end of the words.  That means, for any given word you must take one chunk from each column.  In our "garage" example, the "ga" chunk would be in the first column, the "ra" junk in the second column and the "ge" chunk in the last column.</instructions><instructions>Scoring for this game is based on how quickly and how efficiently you complete the task at hand.  The more time you spend and the more moves you make (to reconstruct three six letter words you need only nine moves to do it perfectly... any further ones will affect your score).  Each round you get more words to solve and every five rounds the length of the words increases (from six to eight to 10)</instructions></info>
